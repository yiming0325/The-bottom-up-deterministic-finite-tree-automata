finalsymbols.txt
This file stores the final state that the tree automaton can receive.

productions.txt
This file stores the conversion rules of tree automata.

normal_form.py
The function in this file is used to determine whether the string entered by the user meets the standard.

print_process.py
If the string is accepted by the tree automaton, print out the conversion process.

print_tree.py
Print out the string as a tree on the command line.

simple_form.py
Simplify the form of the input string for later printing on the command line.

Stack.py
The idea of a stack is used in the algorithm, but there is no stack data structure in Python, so you must create a stack type yourself.

treeautomaton.py
The main function is in it

Run under windows 10 environment, the compiler version is python2.7. The third-party library easygui needs to be installed before running, and the main page can appear by running the ui.py file.

How to run it?
